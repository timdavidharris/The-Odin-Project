In the final task for this article, we want you to write some tests.
You've got three groups, each consisting of a statement and two variables. 
For each one, write a test that proves or disproves the statement made. 
Store the results of those tests in variables called weightComparison, heightComparison, and pwdMatch, respectively.

// Statement 1: The elephant weighs less than the mouse
    let eleWeight = 1000;
    let mouseWeight = 2;
// My code below
    let weightComparison = eleWeight <= mouseWeight;
    console.log("Test No. 1. The statement that the elephant weighs less than the mouse is:");
    console.log(weightComparison);

// Statement 2: The Ostrich is taller than the duck
    let ostrichHeight = 2;
    let duckHeight = 0.3;
// My code below
    let heightComparison = duckHeight <= ostrichHeight;
    console.log("Test No. 2. The statement that the ostrich is taller than the duck is:");
    console.log(heightComparison);

// Statement 3: The two passwords match
    let pwd1 = 'stromboli';
    let pwd2 = 'stROmBoLi'
// My code below
    let pwdMatch = pwd1 === pwd2;
    console.log("Test No. 3. The statement that the two passwords match is:")
    console.log(pwdMatch);

    // Don't edit the code below here!

    let weightTest = weightComparison ? 'True — elephants weight less than mice!?' : 'False — of course an elephant is heavier than a mouse!';
    let heightTest = heightComparison ? 'True — an ostrich is indeed taller than a duck!' : 'False — apparently a duck is taller than an ostrich!?';
    let pwdTest = pwdMatch ? 'True — the passwords match.' : 'False — the passwords do not match; please check them';
