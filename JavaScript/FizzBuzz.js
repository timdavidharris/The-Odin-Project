// Instructions: Write a program that 
// takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from 
// one to the number the user entered. 
// However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead 
// of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
// For numbers which are multiples of 
// both three and five print FizzBuzz.

// Step 1: Write out the sudo code first

// 1) Ask the user for an input number
// 2) loop from 1 to the input number
// 3) output the numbers but
// 3a) if the number can be divided by only 3, print Fizz
// 3b) if the number can be divided by only 5, print Buzz
// 3c) if the number can be divided by both, print FizzBuzz
